# Stock Trading Max Profit Calculator

This repository contains a Node.js script designed to solve a specific problem related to stock trading. The task is to calculate the maximum profit achievable by completing at most `k` transactions based on given stock prices over a period of days.

## Problem Statement

You are given an array `prices` of integers representing the stock prices for each day over a period of `n` days. The goal is to write a Node.js function `maxProfitK(prices, k)` that computes the maximum profit possible with at most `k` transactions.

## Function Specification

The function `maxProfitK(prices, k)` takes two parameters:
- `prices`: An array of integers where `prices[i]` denotes the price of the stock on the `i`-th day.
- `k`: An integer representing the maximum number of transactions allowed.

It returns:
- An integer representing the maximum profit achievable by completing at most `k` transactions.

## Example

For example, given `prices = [3, 2, 6, 5, 0, 3]` and `k = 2`, the function should return `7`, which is the maximum profit that can be obtained by buying at day 1 (`prices[1] = 2`) and selling at day 2 (`prices[2] = 6`), and then buying at day 4 (`prices[4] = 0`) and selling at day 5 (`prices[5] = 3`).

## Usage

To use the `maxProfitK` function, simply call it with an array of stock prices and the maximum number of transactions allowed. Ensure Node.js is installed on your machine.

```javascript
const maxProfitK = require('./maxProfitK'); // Replace with your actual file path or npm package name

const prices = [3, 2, 6, 5, 0, 3];
const k = 2;
const maxProfit = maxProfitK(prices, k);
console.log(`Maximum profit with at most ${k} transactions: ${maxProfit}`);
